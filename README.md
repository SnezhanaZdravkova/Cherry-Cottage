## Design

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are Green rgba(36, 128, 0, 0.27) and an off shade of Black rgba(0, 0, 0, .1) and black for the text as these colours are similar to the grass colours and the farm. The green and off black shade should compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes.

###Typography
The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the Oswald font while the main text is using the Lato font.



## Wireframes

Throughout the desktop version of the website there will also be an alert at the top of all pages except the Events Page. This can be engaged with by the user. The resulting action will open up a modal form to allow the user to book event tickets.

## Features
### Existing Features

- Contact Form - This can be completed on the signup.html page and used in order to contact the farm with any queries users may have.

### Features Left to Implement
- Users would like to have a forum incorporated into the Website. This feature was not implemented as part of the initial release but will be addressed in a future.
- In order to implement the use of the proposed forum, signup and logins would have to be added.
- Alert on Desktop view (Alert present on index.html, about.html, gallery.html, contact.html) - This alert allows users to Book event tickets by opening up a modal form.

# Testing
## Test Strategy
### Summary
Testing is required on Cherry Cottage Responsive Website.

- As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality, the testing performed will be on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing to be done on at least three web browsers and all screen sizes.

- No elements should overlap another container div. All elements should remain on the screen at all sizes above 300px. All carousel items should be controllable with the mouse as well as sliding on a timer.

- All nav links should direct to the correct html pages or to the sections as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html.

- All links to external websites must open in a new browser.

- Testing of form validation will also be required to ensure the correct inputs are taken and that all fields are required.

- Validation of inclusion for all features included in the Structure of the Website / Wireframes must be performed.

The live Project can be found [here](https://snezhanazdravkova.github.io/Cherry-Cottage/).

### Out of Scope
Testing form validation for phone number is out of scope. No Reg-Ex has been implemented so this will take a string value.

## Deployment

## Project Creation
The project was started by navigating to the template and clicking 'Use this template'. Under Repository name I input `Cherry Cottage` and checked the Include all branches checkbox. I then navigated to the new repository. I then clicked the Code drop down and selected HTTPS and copied the link to the clipboard.
Opening a bash terminal in Visual studio code I then typed git clone link from clipboard followed by open folder and navigating to the newly created local repository. The following commands were used throughout the project:

- `git add filename` - This command was used to add fils to the staging area before commiting.
- `git commit -m commit message explaining the updates` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository.
- `git push` - This command is used to push all commited changes to the GitHub repository.
- `git status` - This comand is used to chech is there any new or modifyed files.

Using Github Pages
Navigate to the GitHub Repository:
Click the 'Settings' Tab.
Scroll Down to the Git Hub Pages Heading.
Select 'Main Branch' as the source.
Click the Save button.
Click on the link to go to the live deployed page.
Run Locally
Navigate to the GitHub Repository:
Click the Code drop down menu.
Either Download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE (This route ends here) OR Copy Git URL from the HTTPS dialogue box.
Open your developement editor of choice and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice.
